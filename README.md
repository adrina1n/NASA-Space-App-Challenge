# NASA-Space-App-Challenge
Machine learning project developed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge. The goal is to classify exoplanet candidates from NASA’s TOI, KOI, and K2 datasets into “Confirmed”, “Candidate”, or “False Positive” categories using data fusion, feature engineering, and ensemble models.
